# Flight Delays Project

## Predicting Flights Delay in USA

### Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

### In this notebook, I develop a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-off. The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model. Along this path, I then put in evidence some basic but important concepts. Among then, I comment on the importance of the separation of the dataset during the traning stage and how cross-validation helps in determing accurate model parameters.

### From a technical point of view, the main aspects of python covered throughout the notebook are:

     visualization: matplolib, seaborn, basemap
     data manipulation: pandas, numpy
     modeling: sklearn
     class definition: classification
     

### During the EDA, I intended to create good quality figures from which the information would be easily accessible at a first glance. An important aspect of the data scientist job consists in divulgating its findings to people who do not necessarily have knowledge in the technical aspects data scientists master. Graphics are surely the most powerful tool to achieve that goal, and mastering visualization techniques thus seems important.
