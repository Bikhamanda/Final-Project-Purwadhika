# Flight Delays Project

## Flights Delay in USA

### Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

### In this notebook, I develop a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-off. The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model. Along this path, I then put in evidence some basic but important concepts. Among then, I comment on the importance of the separation of the dataset during the traning stage and how cross-validation helps in determing accurate model parameters.

### From a technical point of view, the main aspects of python covered throughout the notebook are:

     visualization: matplolib, seaborn, basemap
     data manipulation: pandas, numpy
     modeling: sklearn
     class definition: classification
